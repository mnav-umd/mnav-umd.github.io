                <span>Abstract:</span>
                We study how inflation varies across regions with different income levels and the role of retailer market structure.
                Using NielsenIQ Retail Scanner and Business Dynamics Statistics data, we document new stylized facts of spatial
                heterogeneity in food inflation and retailer market structure. From 2006 to 2020, poorer MSAs experienced annualized
                food inflation that was 0.46 percentage points higher than that of richer ones—amounting to a cumulative difference of
                8.8 percentage points over the period. Poorer areas also had fewer goods, fewer retailers, and higher market
                concentration. Using a triple-difference estimator during the 2014–2015 bird flu outbreak, we identify a causal link
                between market concentration and inflation.

                <span>Abstract:</span>
                The US experienced an unprecedented increase in unemployment insurance (UI) claims beginning in March 2020.
                State UI-benefit systems were inadequately prepared to process these claims. In states that used an antiquated
                programming language, COBOL, to process claims, potential claimants experienced a larger increase in administrative
                difficulties, resulting in longer delays in benefit disbursement. These antiquated systems led to a 2.8-percentage-point
                decline in total credit and debit card consumption relative to card consumption in states with more modern systems.
                Furthermore, these antiquated systems experienced at least a 2.1-percentage-point increase in the share of claims that
                were delayed by over 70 days.

                <span>Abstract:</span>
                Standard models assume that food retail chains set uniform prices across stores, following the evidence in DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2019).
                We first show that the extent of uniform pricing varies across products within food categories. Second, even if prices were nearly uniform at
                the product–chain level, systematic cross-market differences in chain and product composition could still generate spatial variation in effective
                price levels. We find substantial heterogeneity in retailer composition and characteristics across MSAs: poorer MSAs are served by fewer retail
                chains while having a disproportionately larger share of large (national) retailers. Furthermore, we show that poorer MSAs have less product variety,
                driven not only by fewer retailers overall but also by fewer products offered by the same retailer in those markets. Failing to account for this
                heterogeneity in retailer composition leads to understating differences in effective price levels between poor and rich areas. These results complement
                Kim and Navarrete (2025), who document spatial heterogeneity in food inflation, and highlight cross-market differences in retail market structure as a key
                channel accounting for this variation.

                  New business creation surged after the pandemic recession, but its causes are not well understood.
                  We establish evidence that unemployment insurance expansion increased business formation by relaxing
                  liquidity and time constraints. Using variation induced by COBOL-based UI processing systems, we
                  estimate that a 1% increase in UI benefits raised new business applications by 0.22%.
