                We study how inflation varies across regions with different income levels and the role of retailer market structure.
                Using NielsenIQ Retail Scanner and Business Dynamics Statistics data, we document new stylized facts of spatial
                heterogeneity in food inflation and retailer market structure. From 2006 to 2020, poorer MSAs experienced annualized
                food inflation that was 0.46 percentage points higher than that of richer ones—amounting to a cumulative difference of
                8.8 percentage points over the period. Poorer areas also had fewer goods, fewer retailers, and higher market
                concentration. Using a triple-difference estimator during the 2014–2015 bird flu outbreak, we identify a causal link
                between market concentration and inflation.

                The US experienced an unprecedented increase in unemployment insurance (UI) claims beginning in March 2020.
                State UI-benefit systems were inadequately prepared to process these claims. In states that used an antiquated
                programming language, COBOL, to process claims, potential claimants experienced a larger increase in administrative
                difficulties, resulting in longer delays in benefit disbursement. These antiquated systems led to a 2.8-percentage-point
                decline in total credit and debit card consumption relative to card consumption in states with more modern systems.
                Furthermore, these antiquated systems experienced at least a 2.1-percentage-point increase in the share of claims that
                were delayed by over 70 days.

                Standard models assume that food retail chains set uniform prices across stores, following the evidence in DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2019).
                We first show that the extent of uniform pricing varies across products within food categories. Second, even if prices were nearly uniform at
                the product–chain level, systematic cross-market differences in chain and product composition could still generate spatial variation in effective
                price levels. We find substantial heterogeneity in retailer composition and characteristics across MSAs: poorer MSAs are served by fewer retail
                chains while having a disproportionately larger share of large (national) retailers. Furthermore, we show that poorer MSAs have less product variety,
                driven not only by fewer retailers overall but also by fewer products offered by the same retailer in those markets. Failing to account for this
                heterogeneity in retailer composition leads to understating differences in effective price levels between poor and rich areas. These results complement
                Kim and Navarrete (2025), who document spatial heterogeneity in food inflation, and highlight cross-market differences in retail market structure as a key
                channel accounting for this variation.

                We present the first representative international data on firm-level AI use. We survey almost 6000 CFOs, CEOs and executives 
                from stratified firm samples across the US, UK, Germany and Australia. We find four key facts. First, around 70% of firms actively use AI, 
                particularly younger, more productive firms. Second, while over two thirds of top executives regularly use AI, their average use is only 1.5 hours a week, 
                with one quarter reporting no AI use. Third, firms report little impact of AI over the last 3 years, with over 80% of firms reporting no impact on either 
                employment or productivity. Fourth, firms predict sizable impacts over the next 3 years, forecasting AI will boost productivity by 1.4%, increase output 
                by 0.8% and cut employment by 0.7%. We also survey individual employees who predict a 0.5% increase in employment in the next 3 years as a result of AI. 
                This contrast implies a sizable gap in expectations, with senior executives predicting reductions in employment from AI and employees predicting net job creation.

                          New business creation surged after the pandemic recession, but its causes are not well
                          understood. In this paper, we establish evidence for a positive impact of unemployment
                          insurance (UI) expansion on rising business formation. The expansion of UI benefits and
                          relaxation of work search requirement under the CARES Act provided unemployed potential
                          entrepreneurs with money and time. We exploit that the actual increase in UI payment per
                          unemployed varied across states partly due to whether states use an outdated technology,
                          COBOL, to process UI claims. We implement an instrumented difference-in-differences design and
                          estimate that a one percent increase in UI benefits led to a 0.22 percent increase in new
                          business applications, implying that more than half of the rise in business formation in 2020
                          can be attributed to the UI expansion.

                          Businesses, individuals, and government policymakers rely on accurate and timely measurement of nominal sales, inflation,
                          and real output, but current official statistics face challenges on a number of dimensions. First, these key indicators are
                          derived from surveys conducted by multiple agencies with different time frames, yielding a complex integration process.
                          Second, some of the source data needed for the statistics (e.g., expenditure weights) are only available with a considerable
                          lag. Third, response rates are declining, especially for high-frequency surveys. Focusing on retail trade statistics, we
                          document important discrepancies between official statistics and measures computed directly from item-level transactions data.
                          The long lags in key components of the source data delay recognition of economic turning points and lead to out-of-date
                          information on the composition of output. We provide external data sources to validate the transactions data when their nominal
                          sales trends differ importantly from official statistics. We then conduct counterfactual exercises that replicate the methodology
                          that official statistical agencies use with the transactions data in the construction of nominal sales indices. These
                          counterfactual exercises produce similar results to the official statistics even when the official nominal sales and item-level
                          transactions data exhibit different trends.
